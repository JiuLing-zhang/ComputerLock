## About Permission  
🟡 When the program is on the lock screen, the Task Manager needs to be disabled (via the registry), so it needs administrator privileges to run.  
🟡 The program uses `user32.dll` to set global shortcut keys and disable some keys, so some antivirus software may flag it as a virus.  

## Lost Password  
✅ **If you forget your password, deleting the configuration file will reset the settings**  
> `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\ComputerLock\config.json`
