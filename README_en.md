* 🌈 Prevent Sleep Mode: Keep your system awake while locked, avoiding interruptions to downloads, transfers, or other important tasks.
* 🌀 Auto Lock: No need to manually lock your screen—the system will automatically lock it based on your settings, effectively preventing others from accessing your private information.

## About Permission  
🟡 The program requires administrator privileges to run, as it needs to disable the Task Manager via the registry during lock screen mode.  
🟡 The program uses a significant number of `Windows API` calls, which may trigger warnings from some antivirus software.  

## Lost Password  
✅ **If you forget your password, you can restore all settings using the Reset Program Settings feature.**
